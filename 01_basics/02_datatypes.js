// code readability should be high
// In javascript we have different types of datatypes.

let name = "Sajjan"  // String
let age = 20 // Number , bigint for the larger numbers.
let isLoggedIn = true // boolean
let xyz = null // null is also a data type as well as we use it to declare a variable.
let person = {id: 1, name: "Demo"}; // object 
let xyx; // undefined is also a datatype in js.
// We have sysmbols as well in js.

console.log(typeof (null)); // type of null is a object.
console.log(typeof (undefined)); // type of undefined is undefined.
console.log(typeof (Object)); // type of Object is function.
